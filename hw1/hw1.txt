Problem 2:

Part (b):
Provide the appropriate git command to perform the following operations:

Stage an untracked file to be committed. The (hypothetical) file is called 'hw1q2b.cpp'.
git add hw1q2b.cpp
git commit -m "message"

Display the details of the last three commits in the repository.
git log or git log --pretty=oneline

Part (c)
Let's say you staged three files to be committed. Then, you ran the following command:

git commit

What will git do?
If there are no files added then git commit will do nothing cause there is nothing to commit. Because each commit must have a message with it git will prompt us for a messageusing the editor. If you do not wrote a message using -m or the editor then the command will fail.
